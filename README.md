## Description

This challenge should be fully containerised, and it must be uploaded to a repository with its respective README.md with the deployment instructions.

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to run it.

You simply need to create a Docker network called `intellisite` to enable communication between the Kafka broker and all microservices.

The challenge consist in building two microservices, that they are connected through the broker:

## Indexer Microservice

This microservice should be a Kafka Consumer/Producer. It should have to consume messages (vehicle detections) from the topic called `intellisite.detections`, index the messages in a database (free election) and generate alerts based on vehicle category filtering by `SUSPICIOUS_VEHICLE` env var (Example: `SUV` category). These alerts should be injected in the topic called `intellisite.alerts`.

## Detections API
Develop the following features:
- Integrate Swagger.
- Implement JWT for authentication.
- POST /users to create the users.
- Develop GET /detections endpoint to expose all detections indexed in the database you chose in Indexer Microservice:
    - The response should be paginated. Use skip and limit as the pagination query params.
- Develop GET /stats to return vehicle counting per Make (group_by).
- Develop GET /alerts endpoint to receive the alerts in real-time:
    - This endpoint should be an event stream.
    - Develop a Kafka Consumer inside the API to consume the alerts and expose them through the /alerts event-stream endpoint.

## Producer Setup

- Spin up the local single-node Kafka cluster (will run in the background):

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.kafka.yml up -d
```

- Check the cluster is up and running (wait for "started" to show up):

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.kafka.yml logs -f broker | grep "started"
```

- Start the detections producer (will run in the background):

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.producer.yml up -d
```

## How to watch the broker messages

Show a stream of detections in the topic `intellisite.detections` (optionally add `--from-beginning`):

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.kafka.yml exec broker kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic intellisite.detections
```

Topics:

- `intellisite.detections`: raw generated detections
- `intellisite.alerts`: alerts for suspicious vehicles (filter by Category: all SUV will be suspicious vehicles)

Examples detection message:

```json
{'Year': 2011, 'Make': 'Toyota', 'Model': 'Land Cruiser', 'Category': 'SUV'}
```

## Teardown

To stop the detections producer:

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.producer.yml down
```

To stop the Kafka cluster (use `down`  instead to also remove contents of the topics):

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.kafka.yml stop
```

To remove the Docker network:

```bash
$ docker network rm intelliste
```



## Now - THE IMPLEMENTATION of the challenge.


## Design of the implemented microservice.

The code base consists of three components.
- indexer
- api
- libs (shared database code)

i've used this aproach because the detections database is accesed by the api and the indexer.

the api also has it's user database, that it utilizes to authenticate users.
because it is not shared, the code for the auth is implemented on the api itself to simplify things, and save time.
as the project grows, one could extract it to a library or even another component.
conceptually, auth needs to be separated of the indexer microservice. they only must share jwt tokens.

## THE DATABASE.
Let's analyze the problem with the only information we have.  

the detections.  
1 - entity without relation to another entity.  
2 - json as the event format  
3 - grows indefinetly. the detections never stop  
4 - whe don't need complex querys to get the data whe need for the api.  
5 - structure of microservices, it can scale horizontally.  
6 - io bounded processing. so it's better async processing, not parallel.  

the database of choice = document oriented, json format ---> mongodb  

  -- it's a pitty because the prototype y implemented was with postgres -- (reimplementation day)

the auth  
1 - user + credentials (2 entities) needs relations to one another.  
2 - in the furute could be more than one auth system. like user+pass, qrcode, etc.  
3 - historic storage of credentials to check for reuse.  
4 - fixed or semi fixed schema, can change very little across time.  

the database of choice = relational --> postgresql  


### Async vs Sync

Mostly the workload is io bounded, so it's better to be **async**.  

I what to use sqlalchemy for the relational db code because i have previous knoledge with the framework.
SqlAlchemy stated that the async libraries are **beta** (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/extensions/asyncio.html), 
so i decided to go for the sync route (mostly becausey don't whant to be debugging for days).

Kafka, get's the same treatment, i don't whant half the code sync and half the code async.
but i also think that for this workload it's better **async**

Theory and practice is not the same. im positive that i need to benchmark the solutions to really know
the gains by one aproch vs the other in this context.

### The Entities and Model.

I'd like to decouple as much as posible the componentes of the systems.

I know that i whant uuids as entities identifiers. This gives me the ability to 
reference them globally (between microservices, and in cases that i didn't anticipate).
MongoDB gives them ObjectId autom√°tically. but for consistency between databases (psql and mongo) all the
entities have uuids as identifiers.

Pydantic models when i can. they are awesome.

Now, the juicy part.
## Deployment of the system.

- First clone the repository to specific location on the hard drive.

```bash
cd folder
git clone git@github.com:pablodanielrey/echallenge.git
cd echallenge
```

- Optionally build the docker images of the indexer. 
because a package distribution system is not in place, whe have to build the python packages inside the images.
this takes time. so be patient.
if you omit this step now, it will take place when you bring up the service using docker compose.

There are two versions of the detections backend. (psql and mongodb).
for testing, benchmarking, and why not.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.indexer-postgres.yml build
```
## and

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.indexer-mongo.yml build
```


- whait a veeerrrryyyy looonnnggg time (eat something, drink tee, or even better, an iced cold beer)


- Now follow the steps of the challenge to bring up the system.

- Start the broker to init the system.

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.kafka.yml up -d
```

- Start the producer to generate detections on the broker

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.producer.yml up
```

- Now it's time to bring the microservice up.

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.indexer.yml up
```

- now pray, pray, pray to the new, and the old gods.
if you pray enought the system will be up and running.
